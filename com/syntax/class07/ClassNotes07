Handling multiple windows:
In order to handle multiple windows we will be using:
getWindowHandle()
getWindowHandles()

WindowHandle:
Window handle is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or tab
It is approximately 40 alphanumeric character ID

Synchronization

Thread.sleep(1000) --> static wait/unconditional wait

Types of Selenium Waits:
Implicit
Explicit
Fluent

Implicit wait tells your webdriver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception.
Implicit wait is written only once and will be applied for the whole session/execution. We can say implicit wait is also
a global wait.

Implicit wait is usually set to 20 seconds. If your element is located in 3 seconds the rest of the time will be ignored
and your script will move on to the next action.

If the element is not found at a given time, ONLY then it will throw an exception
